# afc-gui
GUI for the asus-fan-control project


# Dependency:
* asus-fan-control installed
* python3.7
* GTK+3: install it using `sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0`

# Usage:
Just dowload the file and execute it:
Once the GUI opened you have everything you need: model info, version of asus-fan-control, active temperatures, the option to set custom temperatures or the oprion to reset the default ones.

I will update the GUI with other functionalities in the future
