# afc-gui
GUI for the asus-fan-control project

# For the testing the file is testing.py and does not require asus-fan-control

# Dependency:
* asus-fan-control installed
* python3.7

# Usage:
Just dowload the file and execute it:
Once the GUI opened you have everything you need: model info, version of asus-fan-control, active temperatures, the option to set custom temperatures or the oprion to reset the default ones.

I will update the GUI with other functionalities in the future

Currently tested on Pop_OS! 19.10, should work with GNOME, not sure with other, fell free to test it.
